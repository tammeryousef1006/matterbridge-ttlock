    2.5.6. Endpoint Composition

        not on the Bridged Node endpoint. The Bridged Node endpoint’s Descriptor cluster PartsList
        attribute SHALL indicate a list of all endpoints representing the functionality of the bridged
        device, including the endpoints supporting the application device types, i.e. the full-family
        pattern defined in the System Model specification.
      ◦ One Endpoint: Both the Bridged Node and one or more application device types are sup
        ported on the same endpoint (following application device type rules). Endpoint composi
        tion SHALL conform to the application device type(s) definition

 * Bridged Devices can have their software updated independently of the Bridge, through Bridge Manufacturer-

 * such as supported clusters and/or attributes, for an endpoint. Like every Matter Node, every endpoint
 * on the Bridge’s Node contains a Descriptor cluster that contains attributes for the device types

 * that wish to be notified of such changes SHOULD monitor changes of these attributes.
