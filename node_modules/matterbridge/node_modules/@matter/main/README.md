# @matter/main

Implementation of Matter protocol in typescript with no native dependencies (and very limited dependencies).

This is a convenient single-dependency for applications build on matter.js and have automatic registrations for Node.js 
and react-native as platforms.

> This package supports all Node.js LTS versions starting with 18.x (when Node.js is used).

The following features are abstracted away to allow to be implemented environment specific:

-   Network (UDP/MDNS)
-   Crypto
-   Storage
-   Date/Timer
-   Logger (Default uses "console")
-   Environment (Process and Configuration handling)

## Exported functionality

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All exports here are for the current API. Legacy Cluster implementations are only exported via @project-chip/matter.js!

This library exports the Matter protocol functionality as well as some helper functions as named exports:

Both exports and the typings are exported as CommonJS and ES6 modules.

For more details please refer to the [API Documentation](../../docs/README.md).

### Typescript note

To have Typescript and your IDE know all the relevant exported functionality you need to use the following in your tsconfig.json:

```json5
{
    compilerOptions: {
        "target": "es2022", // Matter.js most likely won't work with older versions of ES
        moduleResolution: "node16", // Required to support package.json exports
        module: "node16", // Required to make sure all imports are js
    },
}
```

Additionally, we recommend using `"strictNullChecks": true` or better for code quality `"strict": true` to make sure that all types are correctly determined.

## Building

-   `npm run build`: Build all code and create CommonJS and ES6 variants in dist directory. This will built incrementally and only build the changed files.
-   `npm run build-clean`: Clean the dist directory and build all code from scratch

## Tests

-   `npm run test-node`: Run tests in node.js
-   `npm run test-web`: Run tests in the browser
-   `npm run test`: Run all tests

test-web will create a /coverage directory containing the test code coverage
