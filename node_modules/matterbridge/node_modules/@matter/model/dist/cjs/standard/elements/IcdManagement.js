The MonitoredSubject gives the registering client the flexibility of having a different CheckInNodeID from the MonitoredSubject. A subscription shall count as an active subscription for this entry if:\n  \u2022 It is on the associated fabric of this entry, and\n  \u2022 The subject of this entry matches the ISD of the SubscriptionRequest message that created the     subscription. Matching shall be determined using the subject_matches function defined in the     Access Control Privilege Granting Algorithm.\nFor example, if the MonitoredSubject is Node ID 0x1111_2222_3333_AAAA, and one of the subscribers to the server on the entry\u2019s associated fabric bears that Node ID, then the entry matches.\nAnother example is if the MonitoredSubject has the value 0xFFFF_FFFD_AA12_0002, and one of the\nsubscribers to the server on the entry\u2019s associated fabric bears the CASE Authenticated TAG value 0xAA12 and the version 0x0002 or higher within its NOC, then the entry matches.",
