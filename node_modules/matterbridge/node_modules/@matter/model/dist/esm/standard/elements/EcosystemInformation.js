    details: 'The Ecosystem Information Cluster provides extended device information for all the logical devices represented by a Bridged Node. The Ecosystem Information Cluster presents the view of device name and location metadata for presentation by a client of the cluster to a user. This cluster is intended to support Fabric Synchronization and be present on an endpoint with the BridgedNode device type listed in the DeviceTypeList of the endpoint\u2019s Descriptor cluster.\nThis augments the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster in the following ways:\n  \u2022 The Ecosystem Information Cluster adds support for providing a name and location for individual     endpoints. (The endpoints do not need to be present on the Bridge for their name and location     information to be present.)\n  \u2022 The Ecosystem Information Cluster adds metadata to support conflict resolution between multiple     sources of the name and location data.\n  \u2022 The Ecosystem Information Cluster supports user control for the presence of the name and     location information by specifying more restricted access.\nA client SHOULD use the information provided by the Ecosystem Information Cluster to help the user organize and interact with their devices. Some examples may include:\n  \u2022 Directly organizing and labeling the devices in a client\u2019s user interface.\n  \u2022 Providing hints in the user interface, which can assist the user in organizing and labeling     their devices.\nFor the purposes of the Ecosystem Information Cluster section, an instance of the Ecosystem Information Cluster will be referred to as an "instance".',
