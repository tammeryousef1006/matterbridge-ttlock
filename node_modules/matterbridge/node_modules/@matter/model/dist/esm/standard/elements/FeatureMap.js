  details: "Each instance of a cluster shall support this attribute.\nThe FeatureMap attribute shall indicate whether the server supports zero or more optional cluster features. A cluster feature is a set of cluster elements that are mandatory or optional for a defined feature of the cluster. If a cluster feature is supported by the cluster instance, then the corresponding bit shall be set to 1, otherwise the bit shall be set to 0 (zero). All undefined bits in\nthis attribute shall be set to 0 (zero).\nThe set of cluster elements that are designated as mandatory (M) are implicitly part of the mandatory cluster feature set, and do not have a bit in the FeatureMap attribute.\nA cluster specification shall support this attribute if the cluster supports features. If a cluster specification is revised to support features (and so this attribute), each bit in the FeatureMap attribute shall have a defined default value (1 or 0), to conform with the previous revision of the cluster specification, that did not support the FeatureMap attribute. The value of 1 means the feature elements were mandatory (M) in the previous revision. The value of 0 (zero) means the elements were optional in the previous revision.\nAny newly created feature set of a cluster shall be dependent on that cluster.\nFeature sets are revision controlled as part of a cluster using the ClusterRevision attribute. The cluster specification is the independent element that is revision controlled. A remote application reading the FeatureMap and ClusterRevision Attribute will then know exactly what features are supported in the cluster instance.\nEach feature set shall be well defined within the cluster specification. Each feature shall be mapped to a short capitalized code name for the feature set to be referenced as a conformance tag in the cluster specification text, including the Conformance columns defining the elements of the cluster.\nIf a cluster defines more than 32 feature sets, then it will be necessary to add another feature bitmap attribute. Any client trying to reference the new feature set will know about the new bitmap, because it knows about the new feature set(s). Legacy products will not know about the new feature set nor the new bitmap.\nFor a cluster whose definition which does not define a FeatureMap, the server shall set this attribute to 0 (zero).\nPlease see Feature Conformance for details on conformance.",
