These typically can heat the air or can pump water via central heating radiators or underfloor heating systems. It is typical to also heat hot water and store the heat in a hot water tank.\nNote that the Water Heater device type can also be heated by a heat pump and has similar requirements, but that cannot be used for space heating.",
