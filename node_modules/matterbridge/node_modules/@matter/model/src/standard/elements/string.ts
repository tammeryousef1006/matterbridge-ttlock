        "only consider the code points that appear before the first INFORMATION SEPARATOR 1 as being the " +
        "textual information carried by the string. Any comparison between such a string and other strings " +
        "shall use the textual component before the first INFORMATION SEPARATOR 1. The remainder of the " +
        "character string after a first INFORMATION SEPARATOR 1 is reserved for future use by this " +
