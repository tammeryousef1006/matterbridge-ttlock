/**
 * This is the default server implementation of {@link RvcOperationalStateBehavior}.
 *
 * The default implementation is currently not handling all Q-Requirements of the optional CountdownTime attribute,
 * so this needs to be adjusted and implemented device specific if the attribute is used.
 *
 * To execute the basic validation for pause and resume commands the utility methods
 * `OperationalStateUtils.assertPause(this.state.operationalState)` and
 * `OperationalStateUtils.assertResume(this.state.operationalState)` can be used.
 *
 * The default implementation will send the error event and sets the device into the error state when the operational
 * error attribute is set to a value other than NoError. The error state will be cleared when the operational state
 * is set to a value other than Error.
