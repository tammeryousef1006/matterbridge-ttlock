 * Generates a BehaviorBacking.events implementation.
 *
 * The actual {@link EventEmitter} for the behavior is owned by the Endpoint.  For the behavior backing we create a
 * separate EventEmitter that proxies to the one owned by the Endpoint.
 *
 * We do this because while the API for behavior.events vs endpoint.events.behaviorId is identical, the lifecycle of
 * observers is different.  Observers registered on the behavior deregister whenever the backing closes, but observers
 * registered on the endpoint remain registered for the lifetime of the {@link Endpoint}.
