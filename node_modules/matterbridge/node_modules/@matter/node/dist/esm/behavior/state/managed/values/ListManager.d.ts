 * We must use a proxy to properly encapsulate array data.
 *
 * This is ideal from a security and data quality perspective but not from a performance perspective.
 *
 * This can be worked around by replacing an entire array rather than just a single field.  If that is insufficient we
 * may need some type of batch interface or provide a means for accessing the internal array directly.
 *
 * Note that there can be access controls both on the list and the list entries.  We do not use the controls on the
 * entry as it doesn't make sense for them to be more conservative than the list and the Matter spec makes no mention of
 * this.
