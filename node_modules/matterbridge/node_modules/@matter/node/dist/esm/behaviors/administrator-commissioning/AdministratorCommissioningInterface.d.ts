         * This command is used by a current Administrator to instruct a Node to go into commissioning mode. The
         * Enhanced Commissioning Method specifies a window of time during which an already commissioned Node accepts
         * PASE sessions. The current Administrator MUST specify a timeout value for the duration of the
         * OpenCommissioningWindow command.
         *
         * When the OpenCommissioningWindow command expires or commissioning completes, the Node shall remove the
         * Passcode by deleting the PAKE passcode verifier as well as stop publishing the DNS-SD record corresponding to
         * this command as described in Section 4.3.1, “Commissionable
         *
         * Node Discovery”. The commissioning into a new Fabric completes when the Node successfully receives a
         * CommissioningComplete command, see Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”.
         *
         * The parameters for OpenCommissioningWindow command are as follows:
         *
         * A current Administrator may invoke this command to put a node in commissioning mode for the next
         * Administrator. On completion, the command shall return a cluster specific status code from the Section
         * 11.19.6, “Status Codes” below reflecting success or reasons for failure of the operation. The new
         * Administrator shall discover the Node on the IP network using DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) for
         * commissioning.
         *
         * If any format or validity errors related to the PAKEPasscodeVerifier, Iterations or Salt arguments arise,
         * this command shall fail with a cluster specific status code of PAKEParameterError.
         *
         * If a commissioning window is already currently open, this command shall fail with a cluster specific status
         * code of Busy.
         *
         * If the fail-safe timer is currently armed, this command shall fail with a cluster specific status code of
         * Busy, since it is likely that concurrent commissioning operations from multiple separate Commissioners are
         * about to take place.
         *
         * In case of any other parameter error, this command shall fail with a status code of COMMAND_INVALID.
         *
         * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v14.Core} § 11.19.8.1
