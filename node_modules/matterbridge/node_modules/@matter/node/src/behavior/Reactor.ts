/**
 * A reactor is an {@link Observer} managed by a {@link Behavior}.  You install reactors using {@link Behavior.reactTo}
 * on the behavior that receives the event.
 *
 * A reactor is similar to a normal handler installed with {@link Observable.on}.  It provides several benefits over
 * installing an observer directly:
 *
 *   - The behavior uninstalls {@link reactor} when the {@link Endpoint} is destroyed
 *
 *   - If {@link reactor} is asynchronous, the behavior tracks the resulting promise.  It provides error handling and
 *     ensures the promise completes before {@link Endpoint} destruction
 *
 *   - The behavior ensures reactors run serially even if they are asynchronous
 *
 *   - Matter.js manages the context in which the reactor runs automatically, either joining the emitter's context or
 *     creating a dedicated offline context
 *
 *   - Matter.js ensures that {@link reactor} only registers with {@link Observable} once for a given {@link Endpoint}
 *
 *   - You may optionally designate resources (including {@link Behavior}s) for locking prior to reaction
 *
 * You should not use arrow functions for reactors as this will prevent you from accessing the Behavior in the correct
 * context.
 *
 * If {@link observable} is a high-volume emitter, it would be better to implement synchronous or very fast asynchronous
 * reactors to avoid accumulating too many deferred reactions.
