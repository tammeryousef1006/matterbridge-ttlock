 * Value supervisor implements schema-based supervision of a specific value.
 *
 * Supervision functions include:
 *
 *   - Access controls
 *
 *   - Datatype validation
 *
 *   - Managed instance generation
 *
 * Supervision is implemented via schema-driven runtime compilation.  We perform as much logic as possible at startup to
 * minimize overhead during server operation.
 *
 * This means we typically ingest schema, create a compact form of denormalized metadata, and/or generate functions to
 * perform required operations.
