         * The purpose of this command is to determine if the active user account of the given Content App matches the
         * active user account of a given Commissionee, and when it does, return a Setup PIN code which can be used for
         * password-authenticated session establishment (PASE) with the Commissionee.
         *
         * For example, a Video Player with a Content App Platform may invoke this command on one of its Content App
         * endpoints to facilitate commissioning of a Phone App made by the same vendor as the Content App. If the
         * accounts match, then the Content App may return a setup code that can be used
         *
         * by the Video Player to commission the Phone App without requiring the user to physically input a setup code.
         *
         * The account match is determined by the Content App using a method which is outside the scope of this
         * specification and will typically involve a central service which is in communication with both the Content
         * App and the Commissionee. The GetSetupPIN command is needed in order to provide the Commissioner/Admin with a
         * Setup PIN when this Commissioner/Admin is operated by a different vendor from the Content App.
         *
         * This method is used to facilitate Setup PIN exchange (for PASE) between Commissioner and Commissionee when
         * the same user account is active on both nodes. With this method, the Content App satisfies proof of
         * possession related to commissioning by requiring the same user account to be active on both Commissionee and
         * Content App, while the Commissioner/Admin ensures user consent by prompting the user prior to invocation of
         * the command.
         *
         * Upon receipt of this command, the Content App checks if the account associated with the Temporary Account
         * Identifier sent by the client is the same account that is active on itself. If the accounts are the same,
         * then the Content App returns the GetSetupPIN Response which includes a Setup PIN that may be used for PASE
         * with the Commissionee.
         *
         * The Temporary Account Identifier for a Commissionee may be populated with the Rotating ID field of the
         * client’s commissionable node advertisement (see Rotating Device Identifier section in [MatterCore]) encoded
         * as an octet string where the octets of the Rotating Device Identifier are encoded as 2-character sequences by
         * representing each octet’s value as a 2-digit hexadecimal number, using uppercase letters.
         *
         * The Setup PIN is a character string so that it can accommodate different future formats, including
         * alpha-numeric encodings. For a Commissionee it shall be populated with the Manual Pairing Code (see Manual
         * Pairing Code section in [MatterCore]) encoded as a string (11 characters) or the Passcode portion of the
         * Manual Pairing Code (when less than 11 characters) .
         *
         * The server shall implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. No more than 10 unique requests in a
         * 10 minute period shall be allowed; a command response status of FAILURE should sent for additional commands
         * received within the 10 minute period. Because access to this command is limited to nodes with Admin-level
         * access, and the user is prompted for consent prior to Commissioning, there are in place multiple obstacles to
         * successfully mounting a brute force attack. A Content App that supports this command shall ensure that the
         * Temporary Account Identifier used by its clients is not valid for more than 10 minutes.
         *

         * The purpose of this command is to allow the Content App to assume the user account of a given Commissionee by
         * leveraging the Setup PIN code input by the user during the commissioning process.
         *
         * For example, a Video Player with a Content App Platform may invoke this command on one of its Content App
         * endpoints after the commissioning has completed of a Phone App made by the same vendor as the Content App.
         * The Content App may determine whether the Temporary Account Identifier maps to an account with a
         * corresponding Setup PIN and, if so, it may automatically login to the account for the corresponding user. The
         * end result is that a user performs commissioning of a Phone App to a Video Player by inputting the Setup PIN
         * for the Phone App into the Video Player UX. Once commissioning has completed, the Video Player invokes this

         * which is in communication with both the Content App and the Commissionee. Implementations of such a service
         * should impose aggressive time outs for any mapping of Temporary Account Identifier to Setup PIN in order to
         * prevent accidental login due to delayed invocation.
         *
         * Upon receipt, the Content App checks if the account associated with the client’s Temp Account Identifier has
         * a current active Setup PIN with the given value. If the Setup PIN is valid for the user account associated
         * with the Temp Account Identifier, then the Content App may make that user account active.
         *

         * number, using uppercase letters.

         * The Setup PIN for a Commissionee may be populated with the Manual Pairing Code encoded as a string of decimal
         * numbers (11 characters) or the Passcode portion of the Manual Pairing Code encoded as a string of decimal
         * numbers (8 characters) .
