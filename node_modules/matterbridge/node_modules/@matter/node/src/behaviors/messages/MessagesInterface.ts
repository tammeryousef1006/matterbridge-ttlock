         * device shall NOT append any message to Messages, and shall return a status code of RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.

         * When displaying a message in response to this command, an indication (ex. visual) of the origin node of the
         * command shall be provided. This could be in the form of a friendly name label which uniquely identifies the
         * node to the user. This friendly name label is typically assigned by the Matter Admin at the time of
         * commissioning and, when it’s a device, is often editable by the user. It might be a combination of a company
         * name and friendly name, for example, ”Acme” or “Acme Streaming Service on Alice’s Phone”.

         * The device SHOULD make it possible for the user to view which nodes have access to this cluster and to
         * individually remove privileges for each node.
