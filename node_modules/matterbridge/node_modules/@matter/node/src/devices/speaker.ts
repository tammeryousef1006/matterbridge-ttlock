/**
 * This defines conformance to the Speaker device type. This feature controls the speaker volume of the device.
 *
 * To control unmute/mute, the On/Off cluster shall be used. A value of TRUE for the OnOff attribute shall represent the
 * volume on (not muted) state, while a value of FALSE shall represent the volume off (muted) state. For volume level
 * control, the Level cluster shall be used.
 *
 * A dedicated endpoint is needed because the On/Off cluster can also be used for other purposes, such as for power
 * control.
 *
 * The decision to use Level and On/Off clusters for volume (rather than defining a new audio control cluster) was made
 * in order to treat volume in a fashion consistent with lighting which also uses these clusters and has matching
 * functional requirements.
