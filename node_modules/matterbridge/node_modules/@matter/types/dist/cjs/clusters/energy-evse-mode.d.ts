                 *

                 *   • A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag can be displayed by the client using a widget icon that shows a
                 *     green leaf.
                 *
                 *   • A mode that includes a LowNoise tag may be used by the client when the user wishes for a lower level of
                 *     audible sound, less likely to disturb the household’s activities.
                 *
                 *   • A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag (standard, defined in this cluster specification) and also a
                 *     Delicate tag (standard, defined in the namespace of a Laundry Mode derived cluster).
                 *
                 *   • A mode that includes both a generic Quick tag (defined here), and Vacuum and Mop tags, (defined in the
                 *     RVC Clean cluster that is a derivation of this cluster).
