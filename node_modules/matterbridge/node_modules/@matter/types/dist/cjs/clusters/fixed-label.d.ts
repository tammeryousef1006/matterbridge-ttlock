    /**
     * This cluster is derived from the Label cluster and provides a feature for the device to tag an endpoint with zero
     * or more read-only labels.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     *   • A bridge can use this to indicate grouping of bridged devices. For example: All bridged devices whose
     *     endpoints have an entry in their LabelList "room":"bedroom 2" are in the same (bed)room.
     *
     *   • A manufacturer can use this to identify a characteristic of an endpoint. For example to identify the
     *     endpoints of a luminaire, one pointing up, the other pointing down, one of the endpoints would have a
     *     LabelList entry "orientation":"up" while the other would have "orientation":"down". Using such indication,
     *     the user interface of a Node controlling this luminaire
     *
     * knows which of the endpoints is which of the lights.
     *
     * Note that the TagList in the Descriptor cluster provides an alternative mechanism for such self- description
     * using standardized tags rather than manufacturer-selected strings, yielding a standardized mechanism for features
     * defined in the various namespaces. The second example above can be implemented using semantic tags
     * Direction.Upward and Direction.Downward instead of (or in addition to) the Fixed Label cluster.
     *
     * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v14.Core} § 9.8
