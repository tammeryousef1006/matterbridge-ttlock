             * used for password-authenticated session establishment (PASE) with the Commissionee.
             *
             * For example, a Video Player with a Content App Platform may invoke this command on one of its Content App
             * endpoints to facilitate commissioning of a Phone App made by the same vendor as the Content App. If the
             * accounts match, then the Content App may return a setup code that can be used
             *
             * by the Video Player to commission the Phone App without requiring the user to physically input a setup
             * code.
             *
             * The account match is determined by the Content App using a method which is outside the scope of this
             * specification and will typically involve a central service which is in communication with both the
             * Content App and the Commissionee. The GetSetupPIN command is needed in order to provide the
             * Commissioner/Admin with a Setup PIN when this Commissioner/Admin is operated by a different vendor from
             * the Content App.
             *
             * This method is used to facilitate Setup PIN exchange (for PASE) between Commissioner and Commissionee
             * when the same user account is active on both nodes. With this method, the Content App satisfies proof of
             * possession related to commissioning by requiring the same user account to be active on both Commissionee
             * and Content App, while the Commissioner/Admin ensures user consent by prompting the user prior to
             * invocation of the command.
             *
             * Upon receipt of this command, the Content App checks if the account associated with the Temporary Account
             * Identifier sent by the client is the same account that is active on itself. If the accounts are the same,
             * then the Content App returns the GetSetupPIN Response which includes a Setup PIN that may be used for
             * PASE with the Commissionee.
             *
             * The Temporary Account Identifier for a Commissionee may be populated with the Rotating ID field of the
             * client’s commissionable node advertisement (see Rotating Device Identifier section in [MatterCore])
             * encoded as an octet string where the octets of the Rotating Device Identifier are encoded as 2-character
             * sequences by representing each octet’s value as a 2-digit hexadecimal number, using uppercase letters.
             *
             * The Setup PIN is a character string so that it can accommodate different future formats, including
             * alpha-numeric encodings. For a Commissionee it shall be populated with the Manual Pairing Code (see
             * Manual Pairing Code section in [MatterCore]) encoded as a string (11 characters) or the Passcode portion
             * of the Manual Pairing Code (when less than 11 characters) .
             *
             * The server shall implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. No more than 10 unique requests
             * in a 10 minute period shall be allowed; a command response status of FAILURE should sent for additional
             * commands received within the 10 minute period. Because access to this command is limited to nodes with
             * Admin-level access, and the user is prompted for consent prior to Commissioning, there are in place
             * multiple obstacles to successfully mounting a brute force attack. A Content App that supports this
             * command shall ensure that the Temporary Account Identifier used by its clients is not valid for more than
