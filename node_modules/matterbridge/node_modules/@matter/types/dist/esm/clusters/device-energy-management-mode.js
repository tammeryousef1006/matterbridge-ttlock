     * specification of the derived cluster defines a namespace, the set of standard mode tags also includes the
     * mode tag values from that namespace.

     * manufacturer specific mode tags. A mode option shall be associated with at least one standard mode tag.
     *
     * A few examples are provided below.
     *
     *   • A mode named "100%" can have both the High (manufacturer specific) and Max (standard) mode tag. Clients
     *     seeking the mode for either High or Max will find the same mode in this case.
     *
     *   • A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag can be displayed by the client using a widget icon that shows a
     *     green leaf.
     *
     *   • A mode that includes a LowNoise tag may be used by the client when the user wishes for a lower level of
     *     audible sound, less likely to disturb the household’s activities.
     *
     *   • A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag (standard, defined in this cluster specification) and also a
     *     Delicate tag (standard, defined in the namespace of a Laundry Mode derived cluster).
     *
     *   • A mode that includes both a generic Quick tag (defined here), and Vacuum and Mop tags, (defined in the
     *     RVC Clean cluster that is a derivation of this cluster).
