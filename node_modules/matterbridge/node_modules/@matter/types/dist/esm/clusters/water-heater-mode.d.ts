                 * to determine the full or the partial semantics of a certain mode, depending on which tags they understand,
                 * using standard definitions and/or manufacturer specific namespace definitions.
                 *
                 * The standard mode tags are defined in this cluster specification. For the derived cluster instances, if the
                 * specification of the derived cluster defines a namespace, the set of standard mode tags also includes the
                 * mode tag values from that namespace.
                 *
                 * Mode tags can help clients look for options that meet certain criteria, render the user interface, use
                 *
                 * the mode in an automation, or to craft help text their voice-driven interfaces. A mode tag shall be either a
                 * standard tag or a manufacturer specific tag, as defined in each ModeTagStruct list entry.
                 *
                 * A mode option may have more than one mode tag. A mode option may be associated with a mixture of standard and
                 * manufacturer specific mode tags. A mode option shall be associated with at least one standard mode tag.
                 *
                 * A few examples are provided below.
                 *
                 *   • A mode named "100%" can have both the High (manufacturer specific) and Max (standard) mode tag. Clients
                 *     seeking the mode for either High or Max will find the same mode in this case.
                 *
                 *   • A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag can be displayed by the client using a widget icon that shows a
                 *     green leaf.
                 *
                 *   • A mode that includes a LowNoise tag may be used by the client when the user wishes for a lower level of
                 *     audible sound, less likely to disturb the household’s activities.
                 *
                 *   • A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag (standard, defined in this cluster specification) and also a
                 *     Delicate tag (standard, defined in the namespace of a Laundry Mode derived cluster).
                 *
                 *   • A mode that includes both a generic Quick tag (defined here), and Vacuum and Mop tags, (defined in the
                 *     RVC Clean cluster that is a derivation of this cluster).
                 *
