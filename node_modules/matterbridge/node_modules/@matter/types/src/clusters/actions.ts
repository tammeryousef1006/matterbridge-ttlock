     *   • Commands to trigger such actions
     *
     *   • Events to receive feedback on the state of such actions.
     *
     * The information on grouping and available actions is typically provided by the user or Bridge manufacturer via
     * some means not defined in Matter, and therefore provided as read-only to Nodes. For example: a
     * manufacturer-provided app allows a user to set up logical grouping and create/assign scene for such groups.
     *
     * Using this cluster, a Node can learn about such logical grouping, provided actions, and trigger such actions.
     *
     * While the origin of this cluster stems from use cases with a Bridge, its server side may also be implemented on
     * any Node which can expose certain grouping, actions or automations to other users.
     *
     * After defining the attributes, commands and events for this cluster, and the associated data types, several
     * examples are provided to illustrate the capabilities of this cluster.
     *
     * Actions can be defined in a flexible manner to suit the needs of the various nodes implementing this cluster. For
     * each action, the commands available for that particular action are defined.
     *
     * This cluster can be used to expose only the grouping of endpoints without any actions defined by populating the
     * EndpointList attribute accordingly and providing an empty list for ActionList.
     *
     * The term 'action' in the description of this cluster should not be confused with the term 'action' as used in the
     * Interaction Model.
