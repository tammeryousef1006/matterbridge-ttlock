    /**
     * NOTE
     *
     * This scope of this document is the Binding cluster as part of the Cluster Library. The Binding cluster is meant
     * to replace the support from the Zigbee Device Object (ZDO) for supporting the binding table.
     *
     * A binding represents a persistent relationship between an endpoint and one or more other local or remote
     * endpoints. A binding does not require that the relationship exists. It is up to the node application to set up
     * the relationship.
     *
     * A binding is used to inform a client endpoint of one or more targets for a potential interaction. For example: a
     * light switch that controls one or more light bulbs, needs to be told the nodes and endpoints of the bulbs, or
     * told a group in which the bulbs are members. For example: A client that needs to subscribe to an occupancy
     * sensor, needs to know the node and endpoint of the sensor.
     *
     * In such cases, a binding is used to direct a local endpoint to a target. The existence of the Binding cluster on
     * the client endpoint, allows the creation of one or more binding entries (bindings) in the Binding cluster.
     *
     * Each binding indicates another endpoint or cluster on another endpoint. Multiple bindings are allowed, depending
     * on the interaction.
     *
     * A binding is either a unicast binding, where the target is a single endpoint on a single node, or a groupcast
     * binding, where the target is a group, which may indicate multiple endpoints on multiple nodes. The binding may
     * also target a single cluster on the target endpoint(s).
     *
     * When a client cluster requires a target for an interaction, the Binding cluster shall exist on the same endpoint.
     *
     * Once a binding entry is created on the Binding cluster, the client endpoint may initiate interactions to the
     * binding target.
     *
     * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v14.Core} § 9.6
