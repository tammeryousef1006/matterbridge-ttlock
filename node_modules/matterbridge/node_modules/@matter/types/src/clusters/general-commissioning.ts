             *
             * ### Fail Safe Context
             *
             * When first arming the fail-safe timer, a 'Fail Safe Context' shall be created on the receiver, to track
             * the following state information while the fail-safe is armed:
             *
             *   • The fail-safe timer duration.
             *
             *   • The state of all Network Commissioning Networks attribute configurations, to allow recovery of
             *     connectivity after Fail-Safe expiry.
             *
             *   • Whether an AddNOC command or UpdateNOC command has taken place.
             *
             *   • A Fabric Index for the fabric-scoping of the context, starting at the accessing fabric index for the
             *     ArmFailSafe command, and updated with the Fabric Index associated with an AddNOC command or an
             *     UpdateNOC command being invoked successfully during the ongoing Fail-Safe timer period.
             *
             *   • The operational credentials associated with any Fabric whose configuration is affected by the
             *     UpdateNOC command.
             *
             *   • Optionally: the previous state of non-fabric-scoped data that is mutated during the fail-safe period.
             *
             * Note the following to assist in understanding the above state-keeping, which summarizes other normative
             * requirements in the respective sections:
             *
             *   • The AddNOC command can only be invoked once per contiguous non-expiring fail-safe timer period, and
             *     only if no UpdateNOC command was previously processed within the same fail-safe timer period.
             *
             *   • The UpdateNOC command can only be invoked once per contiguous non-expiring fail-safe timer period,
             *     can only be invoked over a CASE session, and only if no AddNOC command was previously processed in
             *     the same fail-safe timer period.
             *
             * On creation of the Fail Safe Context a second timer shall be created to expire at
             * MaxCumulativeFailsafeSeconds as specified in BasicCommissioningInfo. This Cumulative Fail Safe Context
             * timer (CFSC timer) serves to limit the lifetime of any particular Fail Safe Context; it shall NOT be
             * extended or modified on subsequent invocations of ArmFailSafe associated with this Fail Safe Context.
             * Upon expiry of the CFSC timer, the receiver shall execute cleanup behavior equivalent to that of
             * fail-safe timer expiration as detailed in Section 11.10.7.2.2, “Behavior on expiry of Fail-Safe timer”.
             * Termination of the session prior to the expiration of that timer for any reason (including a successful
             * end of commissioning or an expiry of a fail-safe timer) shall also delete the CFSC timer.
             *
             * ### Behavior on expiry of Fail-Safe timer
             *
             * If the fail-safe timer expires before the CommissioningComplete command is successfully invoked, the
             * following sequence of clean-up steps shall be executed, in order, by the receiver:
             *
             *   1. Terminate any open PASE secure session by clearing any associated Secure Session Context at the
             *       Server.
             *
             *   2. Revoke the temporary administrative privileges granted to any open PASE session (see Section
             *       6.6.2.9, “Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster”) at the Server.
             *
             *   3. If an AddNOC or UpdateNOC command has been successfully invoked, terminate all CASE sessions
             *       associated with the Fabric whose Fabric Index is recorded in the Fail-Safe context (see
             *       ArmFailSafe) by clearing any associated Secure Session Context at the Server.
             *
             *   4. Reset the configuration of all Network Commissioning Networks attribute to their state prior to the
             *       Fail-Safe being armed.
             *
             *   5. If an UpdateNOC command had been successfully invoked, revert the state of operational key pair, NOC
             *       and ICAC for that Fabric to the state prior to the Fail-Safe timer being armed, for the Fabric
             *       Index that was the subject of the UpdateNOC command.
             *
             *   6. If an AddNOC command had been successfully invoked, achieve the equivalent effect of invoking the
             *       RemoveFabric command against the Fabric Index stored in the Fail-Safe Context for the Fabric Index
             *       that was the subject of the AddNOC command. This shall remove all associations to that Fabric
             *       including all fabric-scoped data, and may possibly factory-reset the device depending on current
             *       device state. This shall only apply to Fabrics added during the fail-safe period as the result of
             *       the AddNOC command.
             *
             *   7. If the CSRRequest command had been successfully invoked, but no AddNOC or UpdateNOC command had been
             *       successfully invoked, then the new operational key pair temporarily generated for the purposes of
             *       NOC addition or update (see Node Operational CSR Procedure) shall be removed as it is no longer
             *       needed.
             *
             *   8. Remove any RCACs added by the AddTrustedRootCertificate command that are not currently referenced by
             *       any entry in the Fabrics attribute.
             *
             *   9. Reset the Breadcrumb attribute to zero.
             *
             *   10. Optionally: if no factory-reset resulted from the previous steps, it is recommended that the Node
             *       rollback the state of all non fabric-scoped data present in the Fail-Safe context.
             *
