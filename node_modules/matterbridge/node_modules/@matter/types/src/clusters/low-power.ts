     * This cluster provides an interface for managing low power mode on a device.
     *
     * This cluster would be supported on an endpoint that represents a physical device with a low power mode. This
     * cluster provides a sleep() command to allow clients to manually put the device into low power mode. There is no
     * command here to wake up a sleeping device because that operation often involves other protocols such as Wake On
     * LAN. Most devices automatically enter low power mode based upon inactivity.
     *
     * The cluster server for Low Power is implemented by a device that supports a low power mode, such as a TV, Set-top
     * box, or Smart Speaker.
     *
     * NOTE
     *
     * We have considered a “DisableLowPowerMode” command but have not added it due to suspected issues with energy
     * consumption regulations. This can be added in the future.
     *
