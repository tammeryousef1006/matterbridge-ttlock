    /**
     * This field shall indicate the level number. Negative values correspond to basement levels.
     *
     * Value zero indicates this is the main floor, which typically includes the main entrance to the user’s home. For a
     * building with multiple levels, it is the client’s responsibility to map each level to/from a FloorNumber tag
     * value, using the level numbering convention of the region where the client operates. For example, if the client
     * operates in Europe, building level 1, which is one level up from the street level, SHOULD be mapped to
     * FloorNumber tag value 0x1. If the client operates in North America, building level 1, which is at street level,
     * SHOULD be mapped to FloorNumber tag value 0x0.
     *
     * A null value indicates that this information is not available.
     *
     * When the clients present the level information for user selection, they SHOULD use the operating region to
     * determine how to render and map this data. For example, if the client operates in North America it SHOULD present
     * the user a list that includes entries labeled "basement", "first", "second", and internally mapped to floor
     * numbers -1, 0, and 1. If operating in Europe, the client SHOULD present a list that includes entries labeled
     * "basement", "ground", "first", internally mapped to floor numbers -1, 0, and 1.
     *
     * The floor number information is expected to be mostly useful to the clients, rather than the devices, such as for
     * grouping devices that are located on the same level. For example, an automation may be defined for all devices
     * located at the basement level (floor number -1).
     *
     * NOTE
     *
     * Handling complex level situations, such as half levels (side split houses), or the levels from an apartment
     * building, is up to the client and/or user.
     *
